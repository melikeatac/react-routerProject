            Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a
            community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will
            dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the
            simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor
            over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor
            boxed brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers who
            just want a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening
            shuffling dishes in and out of the oven. Most importantly,
            Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of
            inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital
            food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep
            our community vibrant. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.

          <h2 className="gloh2">Our History</h2>
          <p className="glop">
            Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food
            world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips,
            while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then,
            Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food
            brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home
            cooks each month. Every day, cooks from around the world publish
            recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings,
            reviews, and videos. The combination of the Allrecipes community
            with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides
            authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the
            brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels.
            You can connect with us and our 11M followers on social media, too.

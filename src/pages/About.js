        <p className="glop">
          Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a
          community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will
          dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the
          simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over
          a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed
          brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want
          a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening shuffling
          dishes in and out of the oven. Most importantly, Allrecipes connects
          home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home
          cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires
          us to do everything possible to keep our community vibrant.
          Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.

        <h2 className="gloh2">Our History</h2>
        <p className="glop">
          Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food world
          by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while
          celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Allrecipes
          has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing
          trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month. Every
          day, cooks from around the world publish recipes and inspire one
          another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The
          combination of the Allrecipes community with our team of editorial and
          kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the
          internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for
          cooks of all skill levels. You can connect with us and our 11M
          followers on social media, too. On TikTok, learn how much salt to add
          to your pasta water or find out if air fryer custard toast lives up to
          the hype. On Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter, browse easy weeknight
          meals and scour reviews of the world's best air fryers. Find
          photo-worth dinner inspiration on Instagram. And on YouTube, cook
          along with Chef John, who serves up creative, new recipes weekly —
          alongside a few good laughs and a well-timed pun. In 2020, Allrecipes
          launched our first podcast, Homemade which you can find on all major
          audio platforms. Our hosts interview chefs, cookbook authors and home
          cooks who share their stories, food memories, and favorite moments in
          the kitchen. If you own an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant device,
          you'll find our recipes easily discoverable via Voice search. Apple
          and Android users can access their saved recipes and search using the
          Dinner Spinner app.
